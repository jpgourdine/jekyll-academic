**Dr. Jean-Philippe Gourdine** is a Senior Research Associate at the [**Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)**](https://www.ohsu.edu/people/jean-philippe-gourdine), at the [Oregon Clinical and Translational Institute (OCTRI)](https://www.ohsu.edu/octri) and part of [**Dr. Lisa Karstens lab**](https://twitter.com/lisakarstens?lang=en).

He obtained his PhD in Marine Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from the former _Université des Antilles et de la Guyane (UAG) now [Université des Antilles](http://www.univ-ag.fr/)_ (University of French Antilles and Guyana) with Dr. Juliette Smith-Ravin in 2006. From 2006 to 2008, he held a research and teaching position in UAG-Martinique and Grenoble at the [_Centre de Recherches sur les Macromolécules Végétales (CERMAV)_](https://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/language/en/the-laboratory/) with Dr. Anne Imberty. Dr. Gourdine was hired at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia USA in Dr. Richard Cummings' lab ([_now at National Center for Functional Glycomics in Harvard_](https://ncfg.hms.harvard.edu/))

After moving in Portland Oregon where he worked as a patent clerk at [Kolisch-Hartwell](https://khpatent.com/intellectual-property-law-team/), he worked on biological ontologies with Dr. Melissa Haendel, working on metabolomics with the Undiagnosed Diseases Network with Dr. Tom Metz and Dr. David Kohler.

Since July 2019, Dr. Gourdine has a diversity career supplement grnat from the [NIH](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/contacts/Diversity-Supp_contacts.html),  and joined Dr. Karstens' lab, in which is getting an additional training in Bioinformatics in which he is learning R, Python using human urogenital microbiome while working on metabolomics data.

Dr. Gourdine has been teaching classes on Rigor and Reproducibility modules and seminars with the OHSU library at OHSU.

Beside his regular scientific work, Dr. Gourdine is a member of the committee of the [_Ankhou_ and _Cahiers Caribéens d'Égyptologie_](http://www.culturediff.org/english/ccde.htm), respectively, multi-disciplinary research group and journal focus on ancient Africa.
